### Getting started

1. Fork the repo as a template.

2. Create a local folder for your app and navigate to it

```bash
mkdir <YourAppName>
cd <YourAppName>
```

2. Clone the template, rename cloned folder to `App` and navigate to it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-profile>/<your-app-name>-ios.git
mv <your-app-name>-ios App
cd App
```

> You can choose any name or avoid nesting, but we recommend to follow the example (including the case) to get the best result ðŸ˜Œ

3. Rename [project.yml](project.yml), [.config/project.yml](.config/project.yml) and [.config/preview.yml](.config/preview.yml) contents accordingly to your needs

- bundleIdPrefix: `org-domain.org-host` to your bundleID prefix
- targets: `MyTarget` to `<your-app-name>-ios` 
- info.properties.CFBundleDisplayName: `MyApp` to `<YourAppName>`

4. Bootstrap the environment

```bash
make bootstrap
```

> See Makefile for details

Than you can commit changes and you are ready for the actual development ðŸ˜Ž

```bash
open Package.xcworkspace
```


### Structure

See [Extensions](Extensions/README.md) and [Dependencies](Dependencies/README.md) for more details for these modules

Main work is happenning in the root package.

- `<#Module#>Feature` naming is used for modules user directly interact with
- `<#Service#>` naming modules is used for modules that are used by developers to build feature modules

Basically your `Sources` folder structure will look kinda like this

```swift
Sources { // Main modules
  AppFeature // Entry point for the app, contains AppDelegate, RootViewController, AppState etc., coordinates app flows
  MainFeature // Main app flow, non-main flows may be Onboarding/Admin/Auth for example.
  <#SomeFeature#>Feature // Any other feature
  AppUI // App-specific UI components
  APIClient // Service module example
  Resources // Contains resources and generated boilerplate
}
```



> **Note:**
>
> _Scripts can be improved later so we advice you to keep an eye on the repo and a tracking reference to our `main` branch to keep your infrastructure up to date_ ðŸš€
