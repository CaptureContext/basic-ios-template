# basic-ios-template

SwiftPM-based template for a modularized app

### Getting started

1. Create a folder for your app and navigate to it

> `CaptureContext` is used as a name for the app in readme examples, you are free to choose your own

```bash
mkdir CaptureContext
cd CaptureContext
```

2. Clone the template, rename cloned folder to `App` and navigate to it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/capturecontext/basic-ios-template.git
mv basic-ios-template App
cd App
```

> You can choose any name or avoid nesting, but we recommend to follow the example to get the best result ðŸ˜Œ

3. Rename [project.yml contents](project.yml) accordingly to your needs

- bundleIdPrefix: `org-domain.org-host` to your bundleID prefix
- targets: `MyTarget` to `capturecontext-ios` 
- info.properties.CFBundleDisplayName: `MyApp` to `CaptureContext`

4. Bootstrap the environment

```bash
make bootstrap
```

> See Makefile for details

Than you can delete `.git` folder and init a clean one for your project

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

Now you are ready for the actual development ðŸ˜Ž

```bash
open Package.xcworkspace
```


### Structure

See [Extensions](Extensions/README.md) and [Dependencies](Dependencies/README.md) for more details for these modules

Main work is happenning in the root package.

- `<#Module#>Feature` naming is used for modules user directly interact with
- `<#Service#>` naming modules is used for modules that are used by developers to build feature modules

Basically your `Sources` folder structure will look kinda like this

```swift
Sources { // Main modules
  AppFeature // Entry point for the app, contains AppDelegate, RootViewController, AppState etc., coordinates app flows
  MainFeature // Main app flow, non-main flows may be Onboarding/Admin/Auth for example.
  <#SomeFeature#>Feature // Any other feature
  AppUI // App-specific UI components
  APIClient // Service module example
  Resources // Contains resources and generated boilerplate
}
```
